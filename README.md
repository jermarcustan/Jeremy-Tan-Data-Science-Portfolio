## Projects

### Master's Capstone Project: Predictive Modeling of Marikina River Water Levels along the Sto. Ni침o and Montalban Gauging Stations using Artificial Neural Networks

The goal of my master's capstone project was to create an accurate forecasting model for the water level at the Sto. Ni침o station along the Marikina River Basin. Three artificial neural networks were trained and evaluated using historical rainfall and water level data obtained from the MMDA and PAG-ASA. The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model outperformed the basic time series model and the other artificial neural networks in terms of MSE and NSE in the univariate and multivariate cases. Moreover, different lag structures were implemented to asses how varying input configurations influence the predictive performance of the models. The results show that shorter lag values generally yield better performance.

### Math 103.1: Classification of Fake and Real News from Filipino Sources using Neural Networks

I compared the classification performance of three neural networks: dense neural network, long short-term memory neural network, and convolutional neural network. The dataset for the language model was comprised of 1,603 real news articles from major news websites and 1,603 fake news articles, sourced and tagged by the National Union of Journalists in the Philippines. The models were built using the <b>R</b> programming language using RStudio software. While all three neural networks (DNN, LSTM, CNN) showed great overall performance, the convolutional neural network was the best model in terms of accuracy, loss, and kappa in predicting and classifying the fake news Filipino language dataset.
