# Jeremy Tan Data Science Portfolio
This repository contains all the data science and applied mathematics-related projects completed by Jeremy Tan as part of the 5-year BS Applied Mathematics to Master's in Data Science program at Ateneo de Manila University.

## Projects
### Math 103.1 Classification of Fake and Real News from Filipino Sources using Neural Networks

We compared the classification performance of three neural networks: dense neural network, long short-term memory neural network, and convolutional neural network. The dataset for the language model comprises 1,603 real news articles from major news websites and 1,603 fake news articles, sourced and tagged by the National Union of Journalists in the Philippines. The models were built using the <b>R</b> programming language using RStudio software. While all three neural networks (DNN, LSTM, CNN) showed great overall performance, the convolutional neural network was the best model in terms of accuracy, loss, and kappa in predicting and classifying the fake news Filipino language dataset.
