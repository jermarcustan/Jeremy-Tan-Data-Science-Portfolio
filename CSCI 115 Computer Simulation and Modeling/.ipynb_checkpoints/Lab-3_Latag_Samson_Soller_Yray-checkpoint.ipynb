    "> Collisions between boids happen more often when the boids cannot maintain a clear line of sight. We observed that the boids converge and collide periodically throughout their movement. However, when the boids can maintain a clear line of sight, they manage to be able to avoid other boids, and thus lessen collisions. The collective visual movements of the boids before implementation is a lot flatter, and their movements mimic a cylindrical path. However, the visuals of the boids after implementation has a lot more volume, and their movements mimic a donut or a torus path."
