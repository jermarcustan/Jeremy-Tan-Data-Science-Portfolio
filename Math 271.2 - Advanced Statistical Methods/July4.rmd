This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

```{r}
library(tseries)
library(TSA)
library(forecast)
library(fGarch)
```
```{r}
data("usd.hkd")
forex = usd.hkd$hkrate
```

Assume ARMA(0,0) for the X_t
```{r}
vol = garchFit(~garch(1,0), data = forex)
```
```{r}
summary(vol)
```
Assume ARMA(2,1) for the X_t (the mean model)

```{r}
vol.arma21 = garchFit(~arma(2,1) + garch(1,0), data = forex)
```
```{r}
summary(vol.arma21)
```
Since phi_2 is not significant, we test out ARMA(1,1).

```{r}
vol.arma11 = garchFit(~arma(1,1) + garch(1,0), data = forex)
  

```
```{r}
summary(vol.arma11)
```

In terms of AIC, the best model is ARMA(2,1).
But the AIC is very close, so we choose the reduced model ARMA(1,1) based on parsimony.



```{r}
fit.vol = volatility(vol.arma11) # gives the sigma_t
# This is the standardized residuals
fit.vol.sr = residuals(vol.arma11) / fit.vol

```

```{r}
Box.test(fit.vol.sr, type = "Ljung")
```

We fail to reject the null hypothesis. The residuals are not correlated.

```{r}
acf(fit.vol.sr)
```

```{r}
Box.test(fit.vol.sr^2, type = 'Ljung')
```
The squared standardized residuals are uncorrelated.

```{r}
forex.p = predict(vol.arma11)
forex.p
```
meanForecast is the forecast of X_t
standardDeviation is the forecast of sigma_t

```{r}
forex.p = predict(vol.arma11, n.ahead = 5, plot = T)
```

```{r}
forex.p$standardDeviation
```

```{r}
forex.p
```
