```{r}
library(TSA)
library(tseries)
data("usd.hkd")
forex = usd.hkd$hkrate
plot(forex)
```

```{r}
adf.test(forex)
```

Since p < 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. The time series is stationary.

```{r}
Box.test(forex, type = "Ljung")
```

The time series exhibits autocorrelation.

```{r}
acf(forex) # MA(1)
pacf(forex) # AR(2)
```

```{r}
arima(forex, order = c(2,0,0))
arima(forex, order = c(2,0,1))
arima(forex, order = c(0,0,1))
```
For ARMA(2,0), since the intercept (mu) is zero, the mean is zero so phi_0 is zero and we can drop it in the equation.

We select ARMA(2,1) as the best fitting model since it has the most negative AIC.

ARMA(2,1): X_t = 0.2899X_t-1 - 0.0588X_t-2 - 0.4763Z_t-1 + Z_t

```{r}
arma21 = arima(forex, order = c(2,0,1))
predict(arma21, 5)
```
```{r}
library(forecast)
arma21.2 = Arima(forex, order = c(2,0,1))
forecast(arma21.2, h = 5)
```
```{r}
arma21.2
```
