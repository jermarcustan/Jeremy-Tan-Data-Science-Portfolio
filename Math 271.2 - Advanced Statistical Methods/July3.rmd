```{r}
data("usd.hkd")
forex = usd.hkd$hkrate
arma21 = Arima(forex, order = c(2,0,1))
arma21
```

phi_2 is not significant since 0 is in the interval.
We check ARMA(1,1)
```{r}
arma11 = Arima(forex, order = c(1,0,1))
arma11
```
We stick with arma(2,1)
```{r}
res.arma21 = arma21$residuals
```

```{r}
tsdiag(arma21)
```
The Y_t's are not correlated.

Check squared residuals (Y_t^2)
```{r}
Box.test(res.arma21^2, type = "Ljung")
```
Since p< 0.05, the squared residuals are correlated.
Our data exhibits the ARCH effect.

```{r}
y2 = res.arma21^2
pacf(y2)
```
We test out ARCH(1)

```{r}
vol.ar1 = arima(y2, order = c(1,0,0))
vol.ar1
```

Y_t = (sigma_t)(epsilon_t)

alpha_1 = phi_1 + theta_1 = 0.2517 + 0 = 0.2517
alpha_0 = (0.0007)(1-0.2517) = 0.00052
sigma_t^2 = 0.00052 + 0.2517Y^2_t-1
